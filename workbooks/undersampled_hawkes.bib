	abstract = {A widely used signal processing paradigm is the state-space model. The state-space model is defined by two equations: an observation equation that describes how the hidden state or latent process is observed and a state equation that defines the evolution of the process through time. Inspired by neurophysiology experiments in which neural spiking activity is induced by an implicit (latent) stimulus, we develop an algorithm to estimate a state-space model observed through point process measurements. We represent the latent process modulating the neural spiking activity as a gaussian autoregressive model driven by an external stimulus. Given the latent process, neural spiking activity is characterized as a general point process defined by its conditional intensity function. We develop an approximate expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the unobservable state-space process, its parameters, and the parameters of the point process. The EM algorithm combines a point process recursive nonlinear filter algorithm, the fixed interval smoothing algorithm, and the state-space covariance algorithm to compute the complete data log likelihood efficiently. We use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based on the time-rescaling theorem to evaluate agreement between the model and point process data. We illustrate the model with two simulated data examples: an ensemble of Poisson neurons driven by a common stimulus and a single neuron whose conditional intensity function is approximated as a local Bernoulli process.},

Schuhmacher considered dependent superposition, truncated the individual point processes to 0–1 point processes and then applied Stein’s method to the latter. In this paper, we adopt a different approach to the problem by using Palm theory and Stein’s method, thereby expressing the error bounds in terms of the mean measures of the individual point processes, which is not possible with Schuhmacher’s approach. We consider locally dependent superposition as a generalization of the locally dependent point process introduced in Chen and Xia [Ann.

Here both (F4) condition and the convexity condition are removed by making use of predictable sets rather than stopping sets.

Double sums of variables in the logarithm of the likelihood function with respect to the earthquake occurrence data is reduce to a single sum by using the recursive relation of the integrands in the Gamma transformation of the modified Omori functions. Then the integral is computed in unusually high accuracy by using the Double Exponential transformation followed by an application of the trapezoidal rule with an equal mesh size. The computing run time is greatly improved to be proportional to the number of recorded earthquakes N compared to the order of N² for the naive computation method. The present numerical procedures put the parameter estimation of the ETAS model to practical use in large number of occurrence records.},

We give an application of the recently developed martingale-based approach to the study of N{\textbackslash}mathbf\{N\} via Λ.{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}. A statistical model is defined by letting Λi(t)=αi(t)Yi(t),i=1,⋯,k,{\textbackslash}Lambda\_i(t) = {\textbackslash}alpha\_i(t)Y\_i(t), i = 1, {\textbackslash}cdots, k, where α=(α1,⋯,αk){\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} = ({\textbackslash}alpha\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, {\textbackslash}alpha\_k) is an unknown nonnegative function while Y=(Y1,⋯,Yk),{\textbackslash}mathbf\{Y\} = (Y\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, Y\_k), together with N,{\textbackslash}mathbf\{N\}, is a process observable over a certain time interval. Special cases are time-continuous Markov chains on finite state spaces, birth and death processes and models for survival analysis with censored data. The model is termed nonparametric when α{\textbackslash}mathbf\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} is allowed to vary arbitrarily except for regularity conditions. The existence of complete and sufficient statistics for this model is studied. An empirical process estimating βi(t)=∫t0αi(s)ds{\textbackslash}beta\_i(t) = {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}t\_0 {\textbackslash}alpha\_i(s) ds is given and studied by means of the theory of stochastic integrals. This empirical process is intended for plotting purposes and it generalizes the empirical cumulative hazard rate from survival analysis and is related to the product limit estimator. Consistency and weak convergence results are given. Tests for comparison of two counting processes, generalizing the two sample rank tests, are defined and studied. Finally, an application to a set of biological data is given.},

These events are modeled by a Hawkes process. The biological problem is actually complex enough to need a nonasymptotic penalized model selection approach. We provide a theoretical penalty that satisfies an oracle inequality even for quite complex families of models. The consecutive theoretical estimator is shown to be adaptive minimax for Hölderian functions with regularity in (1/2, 1]: those aspects have not yet been studied for the Hawkes’ process. Moreover, we introduce an efficient strategy, named Islands, which is not classically used in model selection, but that happens to be particularly relevant to the biological question we want to answer. Since a multiplicative constant in the theoretical penalty is not computable in practice, we provide extensive simulations to find a data-driven calibration of this constant. The results obtained on real genomic data are coherent with biological knowledge and eventually refine them.},

	abstract = {We develop a canonical framework for the study of the problem of registration of multiple point processes subjected to warping, known as the problem of separation of amplitude and phase variation. The amplitude variation of a real random function \{Y(x):x∈[0,1]\}\{Y(x):x∈[0,1]\}{\textbackslash}\{Y(x):x{\textbackslash}in[0,1]{\textbackslash}\} corresponds to its random oscillations in the yyy-axis, typically encapsulated by its (co)variation around a mean level. In contrast, its phase variation refers to fluctuations in the xxx-axis, often caused by random time changes. We formalise similar notions for a point process, and nonparametrically separate them based on realisations of i.i.d. copies \{Πi\}\{Πi\}{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}Pi\_\{i\}{\textbackslash}\} of the phase-varying point process. A key element in our approach is to demonstrate that when the classical phase variation assumptions of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) are applied to the point process case, they become equivalent to conditions interpretable through the prism of the theory of optimal transportation of measure. We demonstrate that these induce a natural Wasserstein geometry tailored to the warping problem, including a formal notion of bias expressing over-registration. Within this framework, we construct nonparametric estimators that tend to avoid over-registration in finite samples. We show that they consistently estimate the warp maps, consistently estimate the structural mean, and consistently register the warped point processes, even in a sparse sampling regime. We also establish convergence rates, and derive n‾√n{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}-consistency and a central limit theorem in the Cox process case under dense sampling, showing rate optimality of our structural mean estimator in that case.},

	abstract = {Maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation has hitherto been viewed as a practical but flawed alternative to maximum likelihood estimation, necessary because the maximum likelihood estimator is too hard to compute, but flawed because of its inefficiency when the spatial interactions are strong. We demonstrate that a single Newton-Raphson step starting from the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator produces an estimator which is close to the maximum likelihood estimator in terms of its actual value, attained likelihood, and efficiency, even in the presence of strong interactions. This hybrid technique greatly increases the practical applicability of pseudo-likelihood-based estimation. Additionally, in the case of the spatial point processes, we propose a proper maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator which is different from the conventional one. The proper maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator clearly shows better performance than the conventional one does when the spatial interactions are strong.},

It is possible to superpose a locally stable spatial point process X with a complementary spatial point process Y to obtain a Poisson process X ⋃ Y with intensity function β. Underlying this is a bivariate spatial birth-death process (Xt, Yt) which converges towards the distribution of (X, Y). We study the joint distribution of X and Y, and their marginal and conditional distributions. In particular, we introduce a fast and easy simulation procedure for Y conditional on X. This may be used for model checking: given a model for the Papangelou intensity of the original spatial point process, this model is used to generate the complementary process, and the resulting superposition is a Poisson process with intensity function β if and only if the true Papangelou intensity is used. Whether the superposition is actually such a Poisson process can easily be examined using well-known results and fast simulation procedures for Poisson processes. We illustrate this approach to model checking in the case of a Strauss process.},

Expressions for the evolution of these processes and especially for their joint occurrence statistics are derived. Compound RPP's, which are RPP's whose intensity functions are themselves stochastic processes, are shown to be RPP's whose intensity functions are given as the causal minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) estimates of the given intensity functions. The superposition of two independent RPP's is shown to yield an RPP whose intensity is given as a causal least squares estimate of the appropriate combination of the two given intensity functions. A general likelihood-ratio formula for the detection of compound RPP's is obtained. Singular detection cases are characterized. Detection procedures thai use only the total number of counts are discussed. As an example, the optimal detection scheme for signals of the random-telegraph type with unknown transition intensities is derived.},

They can be simulated from a Poisson process by time scaling with the cumulative intensity. The paths of the cumulative intensity are often generated with a discretization method. However, discretization introduces bias into the simulation results. The magnitude of the bias is difficult to quantify. This paper develops a sampling method that eliminates the need to discretize the cumulative intensity. The method is based on a projection argument and leads to unbiased simulation estimators. It is exemplified for a point process whose intensity is a function of a jump-diffusion process and the point process itself. In this setting, the method facilitates the exact sampling of both the point process and the driving jump-diffusion process. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

Our study is motivated by modelling the counts of new cases at the onset of a stochastic epidemic, allowing for the facts that only a part of the cases is detected, and that the detection mechanism may affect the evolution of the epidemic. In this setting, the offspring mean is closely related to the spreading potential of the disease, while the second moment is connected to the variability of the mean estimators. Inference for branching processes is known for its nonstandard characteristics, as compared with classical inference. When, in addition, the true process cannot be directly observed, the problem of inference suffers significant further perturbations. We propose nonparametric estimators related to those used when the underlying process is fully observed, but suitably modified to take into account the intricate dependence structure induced by the partial observation and the interaction scheme. We show consistency, derive the limiting laws of the estimators, and construct asymptotic confidence intervals, all valid conditionally on the explosion set.},

The method is an extension of Berman \& Turner's (1992) device for maximizing the likelihoods of inhomogeneous spatial Poisson processes. For a very wide class of spatial point process models the likelihood is intractable, while the pseudolikelihood is known explicitly, except for the computation of an integral over the sampling region. Approximation of this integral by a finite sum in a special way yields an approximate pseudolikelihood which is formally equivalent to the (weighted) likelihood of a loglinear model with Poisson responses. This can be maximized using standard statistical software for generalized linear or additive models, provided the conditional intensity of the process takes an ‘exponential family’ form. Using this approach a wide variety of spatial point process models of Gibbs type can be fitted rapidly, incorporating spatial trends, interaction between points, dependence on spatial covariates, and mark information.},

In this paper, we consider multivariate counting processes depending on an unknown function parameter to be estimated by linear combinations of a fixed dictionary. To select coefficients, we propose an adaptive ℓ1ℓ1{\textbackslash}ell\_\{1\}-penalization methodology, where data-driven weights of the penalty are derived from new Bernstein type inequalities for martingales. Oracle inequalities are established under assumptions on the Gram matrix of the dictionary. Nonasymptotic probabilistic results for multivariate Hawkes processes are proven, which allows us to check these assumptions by considering general dictionaries based on histograms, Fourier or wavelet bases. Motivated by problems of neuronal activity inference, we finally carry out a simulation study for multivariate Hawkes processes and compare our methodology with the adaptive Lasso procedure proposed by Zou in (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1418–1429). We observe an excellent behavior of our procedure. We rely on theoretical aspects for the essential question of tuning our methodology. Unlike adaptive Lasso of (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1418–1429), our tuning procedure is proven to be robust with respect to all the parameters of the problem, revealing its potential for concrete purposes, in particular in neuroscience.},

Current approaches have focused on advancing the use of parametric or semiparametric probability models of the underlying stochastic process, where the probabilistic distribution is characterized at each time point with basic statistics such as mean and variance. To directly capture and analyze the average and variability in the observation space of the spike trains, we focus on a data-driven approach where statistics are defined and computed in a function space in which the spike trains are viewed as individual points. Based on the definition of a “Euclidean” metric, a recent paper introduced the notion of the mean of a set of spike trains and developed an efficient algorithm to compute it under some restrictive conditions. Here we extend this study by: (1) developing a novel algorithm for mean computation that is quite general, and (2) introducing a notion of covariance of a set of spike trains. Specifically, we estimate the covariance matrix using the geometry of the warping functions that map the mean spike train to each of the spike trains in the dataset. Results from simulations as well as a neural recording in primate motor cortex indicate that the proposed mean and covariance successfully capture the observed variability in spike trains. In addition, a “Gaussian-type” probability model (defined using the estimated mean and covariance) reasonably characterizes the distribution of the spike trains and achieves a desirable performance in the classification of the spike trains.},

For such rare event data there are no flexible methods available that can be applied when the shapes of the intensity functions that generate the observed event times are not known, or vary substantially between objects. We model the underlying intensity functions as nonparametric object-specific random functions. Applying a novel functional method to obtain the covariance structure of the associated random densities, we reconstruct object-specific density functions that reflect the distribution of event times. We demonstrate in simulations that the proposed functional approach is superior to conventional nonparametric methods, as it borrows strength from the entire sample of objects rather than aiming at the estimation of each object's density separately. Our method is based on a key relationship that allows one to reduce the covariance estimation problem for random densities to the simpler problem of estimating a non-random joint density from pooled event times. We describe an application to model bid arrivals for a sample of online auctions, and also include asymptotic justifications of the methodology.},

	abstract = {Two linear stochastic processes may be separated using the Wiener filter. This takes on a particularly simple form if one process is from a known autoregressive (AR) model, and the other has unknown spectral characteristics (and one assumes its covariance matrix to be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix). This is because the inverse of the covariance matrix C is essentially the square of the prediction error filter matrix F, i.e. C−1∝F†F. However, if one does not know the relative strengths of the two signals to be separated, one has to estimate their power (variance) ratio. We address this problem. Then we show how to generalise the filter to cope with data that are observed at irregular time intervals. In fact, one can achieve this by replacing the elements of F with time-varying prediction coefficients. The derivation of these coefficients, established by the author in previous work on autoregressive spectral analysis of irregularly sampled data, uses the theory of linear continuous-time stochastic processes, and is presented here. One of the most difficult areas in irregular sampling is that the spectrogram of irregular samples is a smeared version of the underlying spectrum. Therefore the dynamic range is much reduced and one can only see the strongest spectral features in the spectrogram. By filtering out the stronger signals in the time domain and reassessing the spectrum, one may identify the weaker ones. Test results confirm this.},

In a typical problem, one is given an irregular sampling of N data in the frequency domain and one is interested in reconstructing the corresponding function in the physical domain. When the sampling is uniform, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) allows this calculation to be computed in \$O(N {\textbackslash}log N)\$ operations rather than \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ operations. Unfortunately, when the sampling is nonuniform, the FFT does not apply. Over the last few years, a number of algorithms have been developed to overcome this limitation and are often referred to as \{{\textbackslash}em nonuniform FFTs\} (NUFFTs). These rely on a mixture of interpolation and the judicious use of the FFT on an oversampled grid [A. Dutt and V.

Our simulated time series for the Hawkes process indeed fall into the different categories predicted by Crane and Sornette. However, the Hawkes process gives a much narrower spread of decay exponents than the YouTube data, suggesting limits to the universality of the Hawkes-based analysis.},

We also consider the problem of computing the integrated cumulants, characterizing the average measure of correlated activity between events of different types, and derive the relevant equations.},

	doi = {10.1016/0304-4076(81)90091-9},
	abstract = {This paper considers some problems associated with estimation and inference in the normal linear regression model yt=∑j=1m0 βjxtj+εt, var(εt)=σ2, when m0 is unknown. The regressors are taken to be stochastic and assumed to satisfy V. Grenander's (1954) conditions almost surely. It is further supposed that estimation and inference are undertaken in the usual way, conditional on a value of m0 chosen to minimize the estimation criterion function EC(m, T)=σ̂2m + mg(T), with respect to m, where σ\&\#x0302;2m is the maximum likelihood estimate of σ2. It is shown that, subject to weak side conditions, if g(T)→a.s.0 and Tg(T)→a.s.∞ then this estimate is weakly consistent. It follows that estimates conditional on the chosen value of m0 are asymptotically efficient, and inference undertaken in the usual way is justified in large samples. When g(T) converges to a positive constant with probability one, then in large samples m0 will never be chosen too small, but the probability of choosing m0 too large remains positive. The results of the paper are stronger than similar ones [R. Shibata (1976), R.J. Bhansali and D.Y. Downham (1977)] in that a known upper bound on m0 is not assumed. The strengthening is made possible by the assumptions of strictly exogenous regressors and normally distributed disturbances. The main results are used to show that if the model selection criteria of H. Akaike (1974), T. Amemiya (1980), C.L. Mallows (1973) or E. Parzen (1979) are used to choose m0 in (1), then in the limit the probability of choosing m0 too large is at least 0.2883. The approach taken by G. Schwarz (1978) leads to a consistent estimator of m0, however. These results are illustrated in a small sampling experiment.},

	abstract = {In this paper we review recent results on nonparametric approaches to identification of linear dynamic systems, under nonprobabilistic assumptions on measurement uncertainties. Two main categories of problems are considered in the paper: H∞ and l1 settings. The H∞ setting assumes that the true system is linear time-invariant and the available information is represented by samples of the frequency response of the system, corrupted by an l∞-norm bounded noise. The aim is to estimate a proper, stable finite-dimensional model. The estimation error is quantified according to an H∞ norm, measuring the "distance" of the estimated model from the worst-case system in the class of allowable systems, for the worst-case realization of the measurement error. In the l1 setting, the aim is to identify the samples of the impulse response of an unknown linear time-invariant system. The available information is given by input/output measurements corrupted by l∞-bounded noise and the estimation error is measured according to an l1 norm, for the worst case with respect to allowable systems and noise. In this paper, the main results available in the literature for both settings are reviewed, with particular attention to (a) evaluation of the diameter of information under various experimental conditions, (b) convergence to zero of the diameter of information (i.e., existence of robustly convergent identification procedures), and (c) computation of optimal and almost-optimal algorithms. Some results are also reported for the l∞ setting, similar to the l1 setting, with the exception of the estimation error, which is measured by an l∞ norm.},

This paper extends the James-Stein estimator and highlights the benefits of applying these extensions to adaptive signal processing problems. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of the James-Stein state filter (JSSF), which is a robust version of the Kalman filter. The JSSF is designed for situations where the parameters of the state-space evolution model are not known with any certainty. In deriving the JSSF, we derive several other results. We first derive a James-Stein estimator for estimating the regression parameter in a linear regression. A recursive implementation, which we call the James-Stein recursive least squares (JS-RLS) algorithm, is derived. The resulting estimate, although biased, has a smaller mean-square error than the traditional RLS algorithm. Finally, several heuristic algorithms are presented, including a James-Stein version of the Yule-Walker equations for AR parameter estimation.},

In many scientific contexts, however, this assumption is violated: the measurement timescale can be substantially slower than the system timescale (so intermediate time series datapoints will be missing). This assumption violation can lead to significant learning errors. In this paper, we provide a novel learning algorithm to extract system-timescale structure from measurement data that undersample the underlying system. We employ multiple algorithmic optimizations that exploit the problem structure in order to achieve computational tractability. The resulting algorithm is highly reliable at extracting system-timescale structure from undersampled data.},

The text presents an introduction to spectral analysis that is designed for either course use or self-study. Clear and concise in approach, it covers both classical and modern approaches of spectral analysis. Topics covered include nonparametric spectrum analysis (both periodogram-based approaches and filter-bank approaches), parametric spectral analysis using rational spectral models (AR, MA, and ARMA models), parametric methods for line spectra, and spatial (array) signal processing. Analytical and MATLAB-based computer exercises are included to develop both analytical skills and hands-on experience.},

A more general family of hyperbolic decay time series is introduced and its basic properties are characterized in terms of the autocovariance and spectral density functions. The random shock and inverted form representations are derived. It is shown that every strongly persistent series is the dual of an antipersistent series and vice versa. The asymptotic generalized variance of hyperbolic decay time series with unit innovation variance is shown to be infinite which implies that the variance of the minimum mean-square error one-step linear predictor using the last \$k\$ observations decays slowly to the innovation variance as \$k\$ gets large.},
