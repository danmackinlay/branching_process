# TODO

## Sparse regression problem

- make actual regression sparse
- find optimum by some criterion
- simulate arbitrary inconstant background rate by rejection sampling
- check np.asfarray is not breaking things
- check assignment is not breaking things

## Interval censored problem

- quantify the IIR stuff


## general

- Stop trying to duck-type everywhere; use strongly typed kernels everywhere and create factories for certain problems
